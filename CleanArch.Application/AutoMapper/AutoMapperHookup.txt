To use automapper.
1. Create a class that inherites from the AutoMapper Profile class (This is known as creating a profile)
	1a. The profile class should be named appropriately to depict which objects are being mapped.

2. Map the objects the constructor of the profile class using the CreateMap<ObjFrom, ObjTo>().

3. Create a configuration class to register all the profile classes created
	3a. This is done by creating a static MapperConfiguration method and registering the profiles.

Code Refactor.
To use auto mapper to refactor code,
just inject the IMapper interface into the class and use the instance to Map<ObjTo>(ObjFrom);
